This is a silly app.  There's one big button, and every time you press
it, it plays a random sound from your collection.  It doesn't come
with any sounds.

Things I probably ought to do:

- add a nice directory chooser
- release & publish to F-Droid & Market

Extra features I will probably not get around to, but I'm writing them down here anyway:

- viewable log of what was played
- some way to play a sound again
