This is a silly app.  There's one big button, and every time you press
it, it plays a random sound from your collection.  I threw it together
in a few hours, and it could use some polish, but it seems to work.

Things I probably ought to do:

- move housekeeping chores to non-critical threads
- think about thread-safety around collections
- add Settings screen (buffer size, # of concurrent sounds, directory)
- add directory chooser
- scan subdirectories
- cull unplayable files from list
- add About screen
- release & publish to F-Droid & Market
